## Notes
- The average age of participants in the studies was 41 years old [2]
    - Children are more likely to present with hemorrhage than adults [1]
- AVMs tend to be clinically asymptomatic in 15% of cases (found without symptoms) [1]
- `12%` of AVMs are estimated to become symptomatic [1]
    - __What is symptomatic?__
    - `30-50%` morbidity approximately after hemorrhage [1]
        - 0.12 * 0.3 = 0.036 = 3.6% morbidity
        - 0.12 * 0.5 = 0.06 = 6% morbidity
        - __Overall morbidity:__ 3.6-6% assuming all symptomatic AVMs hemorrhage
    - `10-15%` mortality from hemorrhage
        - 0.12 * 0.1 = 0.012 = `1.2%` mortality
        - 0.12 * 0.15 = 0.018 = `1.8%` mortality
        - __Overall mortality:__ `1.2-1.8%` assuming all symptomatic AVMs hemorrhage
    <!-- - 1-1.5% of the population has an AVM [1] -->
- Neurological deficit caused by "vascular steal syndrome" hypothesized to cause "progressive neurological deficit" reported in 6-12% of cases [1]
    - vascular steal syndrome: the malformation "steals" oxygenated blood from the surrounding brain tissue 
- There are no specific headache features associated with AVM, which may be incidental to the headaches.


- `2.2%` annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured cases 
- `4.5%` annual hemorrhage risk of previously ruptured cases
- Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) have been shown excellent treatment outcomes for patients with small- to moderated sized AVM which can be achieved in `80–90%` complete obliteration rate with a 2–3 years latency period. 
- post-radiosurgical complication has been reported 30–40%
- symptomatic complication rate was reported from `8.1%` to `11.8%`


## Rish predictors

The above statistics can be adjusted based on the following risk factors:

- Hemorrhagic AVM presentation
- Deep AVM location
- Deep venous drainage

Annual hemorrhage rates on follow-up ranged from `0.9%` for patients without hemorrhagic AVM presentation, deep AVM location, or deep venous drainage to as high as `34.4%` for those harboring all three risk factors. [7]

## Treatments

### Embolization

Complete obliteration immediately postembolization was reported in `58.3%` of AVMs that had complete treatment and in `45.8%` of AVMs in the entire patient cohort. The overall clinical complication rate was `24.1%`. The most common complication was hemorrhage, occurring in `9.7%` of patients. Procedure-related mortality was `1.5%`. [5]

- `58.3%` "complete obliteration" 
- `24.1%` clinical complication rate
- `9.7%` hemorrhage
- `1.5%` procedure-related mortality
